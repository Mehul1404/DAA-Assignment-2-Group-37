# Efficient Algorithms for Densest Subgraph Discovery

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting densest subgraph along with edge density and clique density in graphs using two different algorithms:
- **CoreExact Algorithm**
- **Exact Algorithm**

The project evaluates these algorithms based on edge density and clique density across various datasets.

---


## Execution Instructions
Each of the three algorithms is implemented in a separate C++ file:
- `Core.cpp`
- `Exact.cpp`

To compile and execute each algorithm, use the following steps:

### Compilation:
```bash
# Compile Core Algorithm
 g++ core.cpp -O2 -std=c++17 -o core

# Compile Exact Algorithm
 g++ exact.cpp -O2 -std=c++17 -o exact

```

### Execution:
```bash
# Run Core Algorithm
./core <input_file>.txt

# Run Exact Algorithm
./exact <input_file>.txt

```

Replace `<input_file>.txt` with the appropriate dataset file.
